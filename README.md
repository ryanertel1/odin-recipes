# odin-recipes
Recipes website for the Odin project

In this project my main goal will be to practice the HTML skills learned up until this point including:
  - HTML boiler-plate setup
  - Multi-page website structuring
  - HTML list addition
  - General HTML formatting

I will add more context to the CSS skills that will be practiced on this project when i get to that point.
